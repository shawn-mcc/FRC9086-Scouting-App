### Partials act kind of like code templates. Basically, whenever there's code we know we're going to use over and over again in lots of pages, we can write them here and call them. This way our code is cleaner because it's shorter and eaiser to read, as well as making our lives way eaiser if we need to update something since we can update it in one spot instead of having to go through every single page and change code.
