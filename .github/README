# DO NOT EDIT OR MODIFY ANYTHING IN THIS FOLDER
## This folder holds Github settings and won't actually be uploaded to the server. 
### Right now the only file in here is CODEOWNERS, which I'm using to enforce Code Reviews before any of you push to main. I'll eventually lift this restriction from you guys and/or add more of you to the list once I know you're more familiar with the system.
